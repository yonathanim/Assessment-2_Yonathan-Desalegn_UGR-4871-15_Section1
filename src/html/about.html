                <p> Welcome to our movie website, where we finally got everything together—after way too many late nights and endless procrastination. Seriously, this project was meant to be done daysago, but, hey, we were busy watching "just one more episode" or endlessly tweaking details we probably shouldn’t have. But here it is, after a lot of caffeine, self-doubt, and a sprinkle of last-minute inspiration. We hope you enjoy the result of our "perfectly timed" efforts! Thanks for stopping by (and yes, we promise it’s worth the wait... sort of).
                   <br>The one and only MF.
